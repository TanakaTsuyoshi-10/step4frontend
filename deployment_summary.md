# Next.js Standalone Deployment Summary

## Successfully Completed Steps:

1. ✅ **Dependencies Installed**: `npm install` completed successfully
2. ✅ **Production Build**: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build` completed
3. ✅ **Static Assets Placement**: Used `rsync -a .next/static/ .next/standalone/.next/static/`
   - Static files are now properly placed in `.next/standalone/.next/static/`
   - CSS file hash: `71e613b4f606d698.css`
4. ✅ **ZIP Creation**: Created `pos-frontend-standalone.zip` from standalone directory contents
5. ✅ **Azure Deployment**: ZIP uploaded to Azure App Service
6. ✅ **Startup Command Fixed**: Changed from `node .next/standalone/server.js` to `node server.js`
7. ✅ **App Service Restart**: Restarted with new configuration

## Current Status:

The deployment process has been completed with the correct static asset placement:
- ✅ Build artifacts generated in standalone mode
- ✅ Static files copied to proper location within standalone directory
- ✅ ZIP contains standalone directory contents (server.js and .next/static at same level)
- ✅ Azure startup command corrected
- ✅ Application restart initiated

## What We Fixed:

**Root Cause**: Static assets need to be placed in `.next/standalone/.next/static` so that the standalone server.js can find them at the same directory level when deployed to `/home/site/wwwroot/`.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Proper static asset placement
mkdir -p .next/standalone/.next/static
rsync -a .next/static/ .next/standalone/.next/static/

# Correct ZIP creation (contents of standalone, not standalone directory itself)
cd .next/standalone && zip -r ../../pos-frontend-standalone.zip .

# Correct startup command
az webapp config set --startup-file "node server.js"
```

## Expected Result:

CSS/JS assets should now return with proper MIME types:
- CSS files: `content-type: text/css`
- JS files: `content-type: application/javascript`

Instead of the previous 404 errors with `content-type: text/html`.

## Next Steps for Verification:

Once the app finishes starting up, test:
```bash
curl -I "https://app-002-gen10-step3-1-node-oshima30.azurewebsites.net/_next/static/css/71e613b4f606d698.css"
```

This should return `200 OK` with `content-type: text/css` instead of `404` with `text/html`.
